# musician-bio-webpage
Created with CodeSandbox
I was tasked to create a website containing a biography of a music artist. HTML is used to display headings and paragraph content. CSS is used to style and position content. 
# Future Implementation 
Adding a section that allows any fan of the artist to fill out a form to recieve notifications of album and concert dates.
