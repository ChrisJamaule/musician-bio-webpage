    <h2 id="early">EARLY LIFE</h2>
    <p id="para1">
      Kaytranada was born Louis Kevin Celestin on August 25, 1992, in
      Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Shortly after he was born, his family relocated to
      Saint-Hubert near Montreal where he was raised, and where he began his
      music career. Kaytranada's father was employed as a taxi driver and an
      estate agent, and his mother worked in healthcare. His parents divorced
      when he was 14. That same year, Kaytranada began to produce his own music
      after his brother Lou Phelps introduced him to FL Studio. The first song
      he ever sampled was Earth Wind & Fire's September, at 15 years old.
      Kaytranada ended up dropping out of high school to pursue music full-time
      to help support his family financially.

      Celestin began his career under the name Kaytradamus in 2010. He released
      two projects as Kaytradamus before changing his name to Kaytranada in

      had started working together when a photo of them surfaced online around
      February 2015. It was later confirmed that they had formed a partnership
      backed by Pulse Recordings. His debut album, 99.9%, was released on May 6,
      2016. The album includes features from GoldLink, AlunaGeorge, Syd,
